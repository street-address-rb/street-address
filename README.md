# DESCRIPTION
  
Parses a string returning a normalized Address object. When the string is not an US address it returns nil.

This is a port of the perl module [Geo::StreetAddress::US](https://github.com/timbunce/Geo-StreetAddress-US) originally written by Schuyler D. Erle. 

## Ruby Version
StreetAddress::US version 2+ is designed to work with ruby 2+.  It may work with ruby 1.9.3, but will not work with ruby 1.8.x. If you need this to work pre ruby 2.0 please use gem version 1.0.6 or below.

## Installation

```shell
    gem install StreetAddress
```

then in your code

```ruby
    require "street_address"
```

or from Gemfile

```ruby
    gem "StreetAddress", :require => "street_address"
```

## Basic Usage

```ruby
    require "street_address"

    address = StreetAddress::US.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC, 20500")
    address.street # Pennsylvania
    address.number # 1600
    address.postal_code # 20500
    address.city # Washington
    address.state # DC
    address.state_name # District of columbia
    address.street_type # Ave
    address.intersection? # false
    address.to_s # "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC 20500"
    address.to_s(:line1) # 1600 Pennsylvania Ave

    address = StreetAddress::US.parse("1600 Pennsylvania Ave") 
    address.street # Pennsylvania
    address.number # 1600
    address.state # nil

    address = StreetAddress::US.parse("5904 Richmond Hwy Ste 340 Alexandria VA 22303-1864")
    address.postal_code_ext # 1846
    address = StreetAddress::US.parse("5904 Richmond Hwy Ste 340 Alexandria VA 223031864")
    address.postal_code_ext # 1846
```
## Stricter Parsing

```ruby
    address = StreetAddress::US.parse_address("1600 Pennsylvania Avenue")
    # nil - not enough information to be a full address
    
    address = StreetAddress::US.parse_address("1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC, 20500")
    # same results as above
```
